# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Microsoft Outlook extension that validates recipient names mentioned in email content against the actual email addresses to prevent potential addressing errors. The extension will analyze the greeting or salutation in emails (e.g., "Hi John") and cross-reference it with the recipient's email address (e.g., "john.doe@email.com") to detect potential spelling mistakes or mismatched recipients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Outlook user, I want the extension to automatically check if the name I use in my email greeting matches the recipient's email address, so that I can avoid sending emails to the wrong person due to name spelling errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user composes an email with a greeting containing a name THEN the system SHALL extract the name from the greeting text
2. WHEN the user has specified recipients in the To, CC, or BCC fields THEN the system SHALL extract names from all recipient email addresses
3. WHEN comparing names THEN the system SHALL ignore case differences (uppercase/lowercase)
4. WHEN a name in the greeting does not match any recipient name THEN the system SHALL display a warning notification
5. WHEN the system detects a potential mismatch THEN the system SHALL highlight both the greeting name and the suspected correct recipient

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Outlook user, I want the extension to be flexible with first and last names, so that it works regardless of whether I use "Hi John" or "Hi Doe" when emailing john.doe@company.com.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting names from email addresses THEN the system SHALL identify both first and last name components from common email formats
2. WHEN comparing greeting names THEN the system SHALL match against both first names and last names from email addresses
3. WHEN an email address contains multiple name parts (e.g., john.doe.smith@email.com) THEN the system SHALL consider all parts as potential matches
4. WHEN an email address uses common separators (dots, underscores, hyphens) THEN the system SHALL parse individual name components correctly
5. WHEN a greeting contains multiple names (e.g., "Hi John and Jane") THEN the system SHALL validate each name separately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Outlook user, I want the extension to work seamlessly with the new Microsoft Outlook interface, so that the validation happens automatically without disrupting my email composition workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is composing an email in Outlook version 1.2025.x or newer THEN the system SHALL integrate with the compose window
2. WHEN the user adds or modifies recipients THEN the system SHALL automatically re-validate the greeting names
3. WHEN the user modifies the email content THEN the system SHALL re-analyze the greeting for name validation
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL not interfere with normal email composition or sending
5. WHEN the extension is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators of validation status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Outlook user, I want to receive clear and actionable warnings about potential name mismatches, so that I can quickly identify and correct addressing errors before sending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a potential name mismatch is detected THEN the system SHALL display a non-intrusive warning message
2. WHEN showing a warning THEN the system SHALL indicate which name in the greeting appears to be incorrect
3. WHEN showing a warning THEN the system SHALL suggest the correct name based on the recipient's email address
4. WHEN the user acknowledges a warning THEN the system SHALL allow the user to dismiss it or correct the name
5. WHEN no mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL provide subtle confirmation that validation passed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Outlook user, I want the extension to handle common email greeting patterns and edge cases, so that it works reliably across different writing styles and email formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing email content THEN the system SHALL recognize common greeting patterns (Hi, Hello, Dear, etc.)
2. WHEN a greeting contains titles or honorifics (Mr., Dr., Ms.) THEN the system SHALL extract the actual name portion
3. WHEN an email contains multiple greetings or names THEN the system SHALL validate all relevant names
4. WHEN an email address is a generic address (info@, support@) THEN the system SHALL skip validation for that recipient
5. WHEN the email content contains no recognizable greeting THEN the system SHALL not perform name validation
